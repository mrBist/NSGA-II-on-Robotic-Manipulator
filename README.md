# NSGA-II-on-Robotic-Manipulator
Python Implementation of the paper : **Tuning of PID controller based on a multiobjective genetic algorithm applied to a robotic manipulator**

The notebook presents an application of Non Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II to achieve multi objective optimisation in tuning a PID controller when applied to control the motion of a robotic manipulator with 2 degrees of freedom.
